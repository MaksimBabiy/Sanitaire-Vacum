              <p itemprop="reviewBody">I LOVE this little vacuum!! I can't say enough about it. I have a cleaning business and I use it at a lot of my clients' houses. It is so powerful and lightweight and easy to maneuver. The suction is surprisingly strong for its size. Looking at other reviews on this vacuum... too loud? yes, wear ear plugs, I do. Ask and look for a telescopic wand. Mine has one but other ones clients bought, don't. I don't understand that. The review someone wrote about having to carry it around if it has a telescopic wand, doesn't make sense! Cord too short? Yes, use an extension cord. I will keep buying this vacuum when mine dies.</p>

              <p itemprop="reviewBody">Honestly I love this vacuum! Its heavy extremely loud and yes I've had to buy a couple fan blades because of legos and screws getting vacuumed up. But this thing is awesome, its quick and super easy to change them out and they weren't expensive to replace. It has amazing suction power and gets all kinds of dirt embedded in the carpet and even stuff like crumbs right against the baseboards. I've had it for a year and still love it. Its an uncomplicated workhouse vacuum which, with 4 kids is exactly what I need.</p>

              <p itemprop="reviewBody">I have been cleaning carpet for 30 years and one thing that I have learned is that to have the right tool for the right job!!! I have 4 different carpet wands - 3 different vacuums , they all have a different purpose. This Sanitaire is a beast I like to use it on flat glue down carpet. Mainly super long apartment hallways. It’s a time saver. The most important thing to remember is the front height adjustment- you will burn through the rubber belts if it’s grabbing the carpet too much- just pay attention. Just remember it’s a vacuum not a pile lifter - if it is lifting the rug raise it up a notch, real easy. It’s a real nice beastly boy!!! The machine is so well designed - everything is so easy to change -belts -bag -roller brush . It was made for the convenience of the user.</p>
